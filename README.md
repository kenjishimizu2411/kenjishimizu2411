## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Developer in Career Transition** with a significant competitive advantage: **6 years of market experience** at *Alterdata Software* (one of Brazil's leading software houses).

My background is not just code; it is **Business Logic**. I understand deeply how an ERP, a fiscal system, and retail operations work. Today, I use **Python** and **JavaScript** to transform that domain knowledge into efficient, scalable software.

* 🔭 **Current Focus:** Backend Development with Python (Django/FastAPI) and intelligent automations.
* 💼 **Goal:** Seeking my first role as a Junior/Trainee Developer, bringing professional maturity and systemic vision.
* 💡 **Key Differentiator:** I can translate client needs (Business) into technical solutions (Code) without communication noise.

## 💠 Professional Highlights (Beyond Code)

My experience as a **Technical Instructor** shaped how I approach IT:

* **Instructional Design & Documentation:** Advanced skill in creating manuals and documenting processes. I believe code without documentation is "dead code."
* **Communication & Mentorship:** Proven ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders (clients/managers).
* **Product Vision:** I understand that software must solve a real pain point for the end-user (Customer-Centric approach).

## 🗺️ My Journey: From Logic to Code

**"Code is the tool. The solution is the goal."**

My path to software development wasn't linear, but it was always driven by logic and a passion for teaching.

**The Foundation: Mathematics & Education**
I grew up in a home where education was paramount. My mother, a dedicated Mathematics teacher, was my greatest role model. She taught me to love logic and value study above all else. Although I lost her 5 years ago, her essence drives my discipline today. This background led me to achieve high academic performance (top percentile in national exams) and pursue a degree in **Mathematics** at FURG (Federal University of Rio Grande).

**The Pivot: Real World Experience**
After 2.5 years of pure mathematics, life called for a practical turn. I returned to my hometown and joined **Alterdata Software**, a pivotal moment that defined my career for the next 6 years:

1.  **Support Analyst (3 Years):** I learned the "trenches" of IT. Dealing with retail clients, debugging errors, and understanding the critical relationship between the System and the Database (PostgreSQL).
2.  **Implementation Analyst (1 Year):** I shifted from fixing problems to preventing them. I implemented solutions for new clients, mastering business rules for diverse sectors (Petshops, Markets, Auto Parts) and ensuring the software fit the business model.
3.  **Corporate Instructor (2 Years):** A dream role. I combined my love for teaching with my technical knowledge. I trained new employees, created instructional materials, and deepened my knowledge of Brazilian Fiscal/Tax laws to teach them effectively.

**The Convergence: Why Engineering?**
As an instructor, I spent years explaining *how* to use software. Now, I have a burning desire to *build* it. 

I realized that my deep understanding of the "User Pain" combined with my logical background makes me a more effective developer. I am not just writing lines of code; I am building the solutions I once taught, with the maturity of someone who knows exactly what happens when software fails in the real world.
